# Socks Shop : A Microservice Demo Application

The application is the user-facing part of an online shop that sells socks. It is intended to aid the demonstration and testing of microservice and cloud native technologies.

It is built using [Spring Boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/), [Go kit](http://gokit.io) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and is packaged in Docker containers.

You can read more about the [application design](./internal-docs/design.md).

## Deployment Platforms

The [deploy folder](./deploy/) contains scripts and instructions to provision the application onto your favourite platform. 

Please let us know if there is a platform that you would like to see supported.
